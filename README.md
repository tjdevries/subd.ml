Things I want to do:
- Control my obs w/ ocaml
- Neovim to send messages to subd
  - Then twitch extension so you can see more stuff about what we're working on.
- Control my goxlr w/ ocaml
- Bring back themesongs for subs
- Do alerts via subd, no 3rd party stuffz
- Do our own TTS, local models would be hype
  - of course, ThePrimeagen is one of the voices duh
- Have custom client for chat, would be extra cool to have yt chat in it as well...
  - this means i need to start dual streaming... why am i not doing that right now?
  - yes, definitely bttv


Underlying things we need:
- we need some database for storing user info (like.. is this person a sub, themesong)
- we need some way to pass messages from backend <-> frontend
